Hi, this is a small project copying a design from a designer his name is Mark Maynard, I hope it is not too much trouble, I take this as a practice to be able to learn a little bit more every day, I would like to continue in this kind of things although in I do not really have much time with work. Subire commits in this same repo to advance things, the project is done in React Js with Gatsby.
